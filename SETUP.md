# Setting up Evenpot on your own Supabase project

About 10 minutes, start to a working sign-in. Everything below is done by you
in the Supabase dashboard and your own terminal. Nothing in this repo creates an
account, signs in or holds a key, and nothing secret is ever committed.

The dashboard's labels move around from time to time. If a menu below is named
slightly differently, the setting is the same one.

## Plan

This guide uses the **Free** plan ($0). Two things to know: a Free
project that sees no activity for 7 days is **paused**, and the app cannot reach
it until you restore it (below), and a Free organization is limited to 2 active
projects, so if you already have two, pause or delete one first. Check [supabase.com/pricing](https://supabase.com/pricing)
for the current limits.

## 1. Create the organization and project

1. Sign in at [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
2. **New organization**: name it as you like (for example `Overture`), type of
   organization as you see fit, plan **Free**.
3. **New project** in that organization:
   - Name: `evenpot`
   - Database password: generate one and keep it in your password manager. You
     need it once, for `supabase link` below. Never put it in a file in this repo.
   - Region: the one closest to the people who will use the app. It cannot be
     changed later.
   - Plan: Free.
4. Wait for the project to finish provisioning (a minute or two).
5. Note the **project reference**: the short id in the project URL
   (`https://<project-ref>.supabase.co`), also under *Project Settings → General*.

## 2. Build the database

Install the CLI once and sign in (it opens your browser):

```bash
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
supabase login
```

From the root of this repo:

```bash
supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>
supabase db push
```

`link` asks for the database password from step 1. `db push` lists the
migrations in `supabase/migrations/` and asks you to confirm; answer yes.

> **Do not run `supabase migration repair --status applied 000`.** That line in
> `supabase/schemas/README.md` was written for the original project, where
> `000_full_setup.sql` had already been run by hand. On your new empty project it
> marks the baseline as already applied without running it, so `db push` then
> fails partway (at the second migration, with `type public.split_type does not
> exist`) and leaves you with a half-built database. If you did run it, undo it
> with `supabase migration repair --status reverted 000` and push again.

To check it worked, open *Table Editor*: the `public` schema should list the
app's tables: `profiles`, `groups`, `group_members`, `expenses`,
`expense_splits`, `payments`, `contacts`, `contact_requests`, `contact_expenses`,
`contact_expense_splits`, `contact_payments`, `contact_pair_settings`,
`group_simplify_debts_events` and `recurring_schedules`, plus any tables later
migrations add.

No CLI? You can instead paste the files into *SQL Editor* one at a time, in
filename order, starting with `000_full_setup.sql`. The CLI is better because it
records which migrations have run.

## 3. Auth settings

Under *Authentication*:

- **Providers → Email**: enabled (it is by default). The app signs up and signs
  in with email and password only. The app itself asks for at least 6
  characters.
- **Confirm email**: turn it **off** for your first run. On a phone nothing in
  the app reads the sign-in token from a confirmation link (it never sets
  `emailRedirectTo`, and there is no `setSession` or `exchangeCodeForSession`
  call), and the built-in email sender is heavily rate-limited. With it off,
  sign-up works immediately and the sign-up screen's "sign in now" is true.
  If you leave it on, a new user must click the emailed link before they can sign
  in; the link confirms the address and then lands on the Site URL below, and
  they go back to the app and sign in by hand.
- **URL Configuration**:
  - Site URL: `evenpot://` (the app's new scheme: PR #8 changes it in
    `app.json`; until that merges `app.json` still says `splitbill`).
  - Redirect URLs: add `evenpot://**`. For development in Expo Go also add
    `exp://**`.
  These only matter for emailed links (confirmation, and password reset if you
  add it); plain email-and-password sign-in does not use them.

## 4. Realtime

There is nothing to switch on. The migrations add `expenses`, `expense_splits`,
`payments`, `group_members`, `contact_requests` and `recurring_schedules` to the
`supabase_realtime` publication. To confirm, open *Database → Publications* and
check that `supabase_realtime` lists those tables. Realtime still applies each user's
row-level security, so people only receive changes to groups they belong to.

### Repeating expenses and pg_cron (optional)

Repeating expenses are created ahead of time, up to 48 hours before they are
due. Nothing here needs setting up; the daily job below is a bonus.

- **The migration** `20261109195000_recurring_cron.sql` tries to enable the
  `pg_cron` extension and schedule the job `evenpot-materialise-recurring`
  (05:00 UTC every day) when your project's plan offers the extension. If it is
  not offered, or anything about enabling or scheduling it fails, the migration
  skips this step without an error and the rest of the setup is unaffected.
  To see whether the job exists, run `select jobname, schedule from cron.job;` in
  the SQL Editor (an error that `cron` does not exist means it was skipped).
- **Without the job**, due items are created when someone opens the app: the
  app asks the server to create them (`materialise_my_recurring`), which ships
  with the recurring-transactions screens. A repeating expense then appears the
  next time anyone in the group opens the app, dated on its true date.

If you enable the extension in the Supabase dashboard's extensions page after
the migrations have run, the migration will not run again; create the job once
in the SQL Editor:
`select cron.schedule('evenpot-materialise-recurring', '0 5 * * *', $$select public._materialise_recurring()$$);`

## 5. Give the app the project URL and key

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` (it is gitignored) and fill in:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<paste the key here>
```

Both values are in *Project Settings → API* (some dashboards call the page *API
Keys*). Use the **anon / public** key, or the **publishable** key if that is what
your dashboard shows. Paste it yourself.

**Never use the `service_role` or *secret* key here.** Every `EXPO_PUBLIC_`
value is shipped inside the app bundle, and the service-role key bypasses all
row-level security.

## 6. Run it

```bash
npm install
npx expo start
```

Press `i` (iOS simulator), `a` (Android emulator), or scan the QR code with Expo
Go. Then:

1. Sign up with an email, a name and a password, and sign in.
2. Create a group, add an expense.
3. Realtime: sign up a second account, add it to the group (by the email you
   signed it up with), open the group on a second simulator or device, and add an
   expense on one. It should appear on the other without a refresh.

## If the project is paused

After 7 days without activity the Free plan pauses the project. Sign-in and
every screen will then fail to connect. To bring it back, open the project in the
dashboard and choose **Restore**. Regular use of the app keeps it from pausing.

Later, if you want it never to pause, upgrade the organization to Pro
(currently $25 a month). Nothing in the app or this guide changes.

## Checking the database without a project

```bash
npm run check:migrations
```

This builds an empty in-memory Postgres, applies every migration in order,
runs a sign-up, create-group, add-expense and balances flow through the real
RPCs as separate users, checks that row-level security hides a group from a
non-member and that clients cannot write tables directly, checks that the
realtime tables are published, and checks that `supabase/schemas/` and
`supabase/migrations/` describe the same database. It needs no Docker and no
Supabase account, and it runs in CI. It runs on a newer Postgres than a Supabase
project does (15 to 17), so a failure there is real but a pass is not a promise
about every version. It does not run Supabase's auth, REST or
realtime servers, so it proves the database, not those layers.
