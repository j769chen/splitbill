-- balance until that instant passes; nothing moves the row, the filter is
-- evaluated at query time.
--
-- The money is summed in get_group_balances, get_group_pairwise_balances,
-- get_contact_balance and get_contact_group_breakdown (its direct branch), so
-- those get `date <= now()`. Everything else inherits: get_group_simplified_edges
-- and leave_group's balance check read get_group_balances;
-- get_contacts_with_balances, get_contacts_with_combined_balances (via
-- get_contact_balance_contexts) and get_user_total_balance read the functions
-- above. set_group_currency / set_contact_currency already count every row,
-- future ones included, and are unchanged.
--
-- get_recent_activity leaves future rows out so they cannot fill its row cap;
-- get_upcoming_expenses returns them. leave_group refuses while a future row
-- involves the caller, since their zero balance today would move on its date.
--
-- Signatures are unchanged, so create or replace keeps the existing grants; the
-- new function takes the same default execute grants as every other RPC.
