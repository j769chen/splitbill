-- Account deletion, piece 3: public.delete_my_account() and the raw-delete trigger.
--
-- delete_my_account tombstones the caller's profile, stops the schedules that
-- involve them, removes future-dated rows that involve them, takes them out of
-- every group (_account_leave_group), cleans up contacts and deletes their
-- auth.users row, all in one transaction. _stop_schedule_member_left is the
-- engine's 'member left' stop, now shared: _materialise_recurring calls it instead
-- of repeating the update. on_auth_user_deleted makes a raw delete of an auth user
-- (dashboard, SQL) leave a tombstone profile; it does no group or contact
-- clean-up. The trigger is here and not in schemas/ for the reason in the note at
-- the top of schemas/04_functions.sql.
--
-- Also here: a BEFORE UPDATE trigger that makes a tombstone final, the PostgREST
-- pre-request guard reject_deleted_caller() (and the role setting that turns it
-- on), a best-effort audit-log cleanup in delete_my_account, and _account_leave_group
-- replaced so that a net-zero member with an open pairwise edge stays as a ghost.

-- Internal: stops a schedule because a member left (the engine's 'member left'
-- stop, shared with account deletion). Already stopped: nothing. It does not
-- delete the schedule's pending rows; the caller decides. Not callable by clients.

-- Deletes the signed-in user's account, in one transaction (any error rolls all of
-- it back). Open debts never block it. What stays is what other people's balances
-- are made of: the expense, split and payment rows the user took part in, shown
-- under the tombstone profile ('Deleted user', no avatar, deleted_at set).
--   1. The profile row is locked (FOR NO KEY UPDATE: two calls serialise, but a
--      concurrent expense insert that only needs a key-share lock on it is not
--      blocked). Already a tombstone (or no profile) AND no auth.users row left:
--      return, nothing changes. A tombstone whose auth user is still there (marked by
--      hand) is not an early return: the steps below are idempotent and delete it.
--   2. A live profile becomes a tombstone first, so nothing new can name it. (A
--      tombstone cannot be updated again: see _reject_deleted_profile_update.)
--   3. Every running schedule where they are the payer, in the splits, the
--      creator, or one of the two contacts is stopped as 'member left'. Rows
--      dated in the future are removed: every expense and payment (group and
--      contact, whatever created it) where they pay, are paid, or have a split above
--      zero (the rule of get_upcoming_expenses and leave_group), and the pending,
--      not hand-edited rows of the stopped schedules (as stop_recurring_schedule
--      does). They are not in anyone's balance yet. Past rows are never removed.
--   4. Each group they are in goes through _account_leave_group.
--   5. Contacts: their contact_requests (both directions) are deleted. For each
--      pair with a contacts row: a zero balance (abs < 0.01) deletes both rows, an
--      open balance deletes only theirs so the other person keeps the contact and
--      the ledger. contact_pair_settings go only when the pair has no expense or
--      payment left (a retained ledger keeps its currency). Contact expenses,
--      payments and splits are always kept.
--   6. The auth.users row is deleted (email, password hash, and on a real project
--      the sessions, identities and refresh tokens that cascade from it).
--   7. Best effort: GoTrue's auth.audit_log_entries keeps the email, IP and actor id of
--      past sign-ins, so the rows naming this user are deleted when that table exists.
--      A refusal there (privileges, a different GoTrue version) is a NOTICE and does
--      not roll the deletion back.
-- The AFTER DELETE trigger from step 6 finds the tombstone already there.
