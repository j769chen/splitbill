-- Row Level Security policies (final state).
--
-- Every write goes through a SECURITY DEFINER RPC in 04_functions.sql, so the
-- tables carry SELECT policies only. That is deliberate: RLS can express "you
-- are a member of this group" but not "these splits add up to the expense
-- total", so leaving direct INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE open let a client PostgREST
-- call skip every validation the RPCs perform and write an unbalanced ledger.
-- With no policy for a command, RLS denies it.
--
-- Caveat: the diff tool tracks `create policy` but NOT `alter policy`. To
-- change a policy here, edit its definition in place; the generated migration
-- will drop and recreate it.

-- Visibility is scoped to people the caller shares something with (see
-- can_view_profile). The RPCs that legitimately need to name a non-visible
-- profile are SECURITY DEFINER and bypass this.
