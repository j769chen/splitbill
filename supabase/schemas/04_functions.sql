-- Edits a recurring schedule. Null keeps a value; the p_clear_* flags remove a

-- (occurrence dates depend on them): stop the schedule and create a new one.
-- Amount and splits change together or not at all; description, category, split
-- type, payer and the limits change on their own.
--
-- Only the future changes. A pending occurrence is a row of the schedule with
-- date > now() that nobody edited by hand (hand_edited = false); a row dated
-- exactly now() is not pending (the balance predicate is date <= now()). Edits
-- rewrite the pending rows through the private update helpers with
-- p_mark_hand_edited = false, so they stay rewritable by the next edit; past
-- rows and hand-edited rows are never touched.
--
-- Rewritten rows are not repriced: each keeps its own exchange_rate (the rate
-- it was created at) and its base amounts are recomputed at that rate when the
-- amount changes. Only occurrences the engine creates later use the schedule's
-- current rate (last_exchange_rate). The stored payload's splits are normalised
-- to [{userId (lowercase uuid text), amount, baseAmount}], nothing else, with
-- baseAmount at the current rate: that is the payload for the next occurrences
-- (the engine recomputes it anyway).
--
-- A finished schedule (stop_reason 'completed': max_count or end_date reached)
-- can still have its pending rows rewritten, but its limits cannot be changed.
-- A schedule stopped by a member, because someone left, or as invalid cannot be
-- edited at all.
--
-- Limits: lowering end_date or max_count deletes the pending, non-hand-edited
-- rows beyond the new limit; a hand-edited pending row stays and counts at its
-- date. The cursor (next_index) is never moved, so deleted rows are not
-- recreated if the limit is raised again. A max_count at or below the number of
-- occurrences already made (created or skipped), or an end_date before the next
-- occurrence, completes the schedule ('completed'). The engine then runs once
-- (the same function cron uses, 48 hours ahead) so the series is consistent:
-- it creates anything now due and applies completion.
--
-- The schedule row is locked first (select ... for update), which serialises
-- this against cron, the app-open catch-up and stop; it is taken only after the
-- caller is known to be a member (a non-member and a missing id get the same
-- 'Schedule not found' and block nothing) and the stopped state is checked
-- again under it. Everything is one
-- transaction: any failure rolls back the edit, the deletions and the rewrites.

-- Deletes the signed-in user's account, in one transaction (any error rolls all of
-- it back). Open debts never block it. What stays is what other people's balances
-- are made of: the expense, split and payment rows the user took part in, shown
-- under the tombstone profile ('Deleted user', no avatar, deleted_at set).
--   1. The profile row is locked (FOR NO KEY UPDATE: two calls serialise, but a
--      concurrent expense insert that only needs a key-share lock on it is not
--      blocked). Already a tombstone (or no profile) AND no auth.users row left:
--      return, nothing changes. A tombstone whose auth user is still there (marked by
--      hand) is not an early return: the steps below are idempotent and delete it.
--   2. A live profile becomes a tombstone first, so nothing new can name it. (A
--      tombstone cannot be updated again: see _reject_deleted_profile_update.)
--   3. Every running schedule where they are the payer, in the splits, the
--      creator, or one of the two contacts is stopped as 'member left'. Rows
--      dated in the future are removed: every expense and payment (group and
--      contact, whatever created it) where they pay, are paid, or have a split above
--      zero (the rule of get_upcoming_expenses and leave_group), and the pending,
--      not hand-edited rows of the stopped schedules (as stop_recurring_schedule
--      does). They are not in anyone's balance yet. Past rows are never removed.
--   4. Each group they are in goes through _account_leave_group.
--   5. Contacts: their contact_requests (both directions) are deleted. For each
--      pair with a contacts row: a zero balance (abs < 0.01) deletes both rows, an
--      open balance deletes only theirs so the other person keeps the contact and
--      the ledger. contact_pair_settings go only when the pair has no expense or
--      payment left (a retained ledger keeps its currency). Contact expenses,
--      payments and splits are always kept.
--   6. The auth.users row is deleted (email, password hash, and on a real project
--      the sessions, identities and refresh tokens that cascade from it).
--   7. Best effort: GoTrue's auth.audit_log_entries keeps the email, IP and actor id of
--      past sign-ins, so the rows naming this user are deleted when that table exists.
--      A refusal there (privileges, a different GoTrue version) is a NOTICE and does
--      not roll the deletion back.
-- The AFTER DELETE trigger from step 6 finds the tombstone already there.
